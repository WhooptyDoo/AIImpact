# GPT-4o Infrastructure Calculator

## Overview

The GPT-4o Infrastructure Calculator is a comprehensive tool designed to estimate the computational resources, power consumption, and operational costs required to serve OpenAI's GPT-4o model at scale. This interactive application allows users to adjust key parameters and immediately visualize the infrastructure implications of serving billions of users.

Key features include:
- Real-time calculation of GPU requirements
- Power consumption estimates
- Cost projections across different time periods
- Comparative analysis against national electricity grids
- Sensitivity analysis for key parameters
- Data visualization of scaling relationships

## Key Metrics

The calculator computes several critical infrastructure metrics based on user-provided parameters:

### 1. Throughput Metrics
- **Daily Queries**: `Total Users × Queries per User per Day`
- **Queries per Second (QPS)**: `Daily Queries ÷ (24 × 60 × 60)`
- **Tokens per Second**: `QPS × Tokens per Query`

### 2. GPU Requirements
- **Average GPUs Needed**: `Tokens per Second ÷ GPT-4o Throughput (tokens/s per H100)`
- **Peak GPUs Needed**: `Average GPUs × Peak Load Multiplier`

### 3. Power Calculations
- **Average Power Consumption (kW)**: `Average GPUs × (GPU Power Consumption ÷ 1000)`
- **Peak Power Consumption (kW)**: `Peak GPUs × (GPU Power Consumption ÷ 1000)`
- **Daily Energy Consumption (kWh)**: `Average Power Consumption × 24 hours`

### 4. Cost Projections
- **Daily Cost**: `Daily Energy Consumption × Electricity Cost per kWh`
- **Weekly/Monthly/Annual Costs**: `Daily Cost × 7/30/365`

### 5. Per-Query Metrics
- **Cost per Query**: `Daily Cost ÷ Daily Queries`
- **Electricity per Query**: `Daily Energy Consumption ÷ Daily Queries`

## Assumptions and Formulas

### Core Assumptions
1. **GPU Performance**: Default throughput of 109 tokens/second per H100 GPU (user-adjustable)
2. **User Behavior**: 
   - Default of 10 queries per user per day (user-adjustable)
   - Default of 750 tokens generated per query (user-adjustable)
3. **Hardware Specifications**:
   - H100 GPU power consumption defaults to 700W (user-adjustable)
   - H100 unit cost fixed at $35,000
4. **Load Distribution**:
   - Peak load multiplier defaults to 2.0x average load (user-adjustable)

### Calculation Methodology
1. **Total Demand Calculation**:
   ```
   Daily Queries = Total Users × Queries per User per Day
   Queries per Second = Daily Queries ÷ 86,400 (seconds/day)
   Tokens per Second = Queries per Second × Tokens per Query
   ```

2. **GPU Requirements**:
   ```
   Base GPUs = Tokens per Second ÷ GPU Throughput
   Peak GPUs = Base GPUs × Peak Load Multiplier
   ```

3. **Power and Energy**:
   ```
   Power (kW) = GPUs × (GPU Power Consumption ÷ 1000)
   Daily Energy (kWh) = Power (kW) × 24
   ```

4. **Cost Projections**:
   ```
   Daily Cost = Daily Energy × Electricity Cost per kWh
   Hardware Cost = GPUs × $35,000
   ```

5. **Comparative Metrics**:
   - National electricity comparisons use publicly available data on country-level electricity generation
   - Industry comparisons use recent estimates for sectors like Bitcoin mining and manufacturing

## Usage

1. Adjust parameters in the sidebar to match your scenario:
   - Model parameters (throughput, user base, query characteristics)
   - Hardware specifications (GPU power consumption)
   - Cost factors (electricity prices)
   - Load distribution (peak traffic multiplier)

2. View real-time updates in the main dashboard showing:
   - Infrastructure requirements (GPUs, power)
   - Cost breakdowns (daily to annual)
   - Per-query metrics

3. Explore visualizations showing:
   - Scaling relationships
   - Country and industry comparisons
   - Sensitivity analyses

4. Export parameters and results as CSV for further analysis

## Comparative Analysis

The calculator provides contextual comparisons to help understand the scale of infrastructure requirements:

1. **National Electricity Comparisons**:
   - Shows how GPT-4o infrastructure would compare to entire countries' electricity generation
   - Includes percentage comparisons to major economies

2. **Industry Benchmarks**:
   - Compares against Bitcoin mining, solar energy production, and manufacturing sectors
   - Provides relative percentages to understand scale

3. **Power Plant Equivalents**:
   - Calculates how many coal/nuclear/gas plants would be needed
   - Shows equivalent number of homes that could be powered

## Sensitivity Analysis

The tool includes interactive sensitivity analysis showing how changes in key parameters affect daily costs:

- Users (billions)
- Queries per user per day
- Tokens per query
- Electricity costs ($/kWh)

## Export Functionality

All parameters and calculated results can be exported as CSV files for documentation and further analysis.

## Limitations

1. **Simplified Model**: Actual infrastructure needs may vary due to:
   - Model optimization levels
   - Hardware efficiency variations
   - Cooling system requirements
   - Network and storage overhead
   - Redundancy needs

2. **Static Assumptions**:
   - Doesn't account for future efficiency improvements
   - Assumes consistent usage patterns

3. **Comparative Data**:
   - Country and industry comparisons use approximate values
   - Power plant equivalents are based on average specifications

For production deployments, consult with infrastructure specialists to refine these estimates.
